    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I
      whipped these up on my own using ingredients I had on hand. Shredding the
      chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in the end.
      Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!

      <li>
        (12 inch) flour tortillas 3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese 1 (10 ounce)

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil
        over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer
        until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10
        minutes. Shred chicken with two forks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan.
        Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and
        cover to keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion;
        cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken,
        water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer
        for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder;
        simmer for 10 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread
        remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5
        tablespoons Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into
        the baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with
        remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is
        melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
